I had a long dream of learning C++ properly, and due the lockdown during Covid19 pandemic I finally had the chance to review my learnings and fix what I knew wrong. I will be writing articles on C++ to make my learnings persistent. They won't be in depth as other articles of C++ experts. I didn't get any chance to work anywhere as a C++ developer, there might be silly or grave mistakes here and there. For the time being, I will ignore those and just move along to maintain my flow.

```cpp:title=c++

#include <iostream>

int main void(){
  std::cout << "Hello WOrld" << std::endl;
}

```
