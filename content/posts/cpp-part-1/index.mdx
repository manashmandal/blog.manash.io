I had a long dream of learning C++ properly, and due the lockdown during Covid19 pandemic I finally had the chance to review my learnings and fix what I knew wrong. I will be writing notes on C++ to make my learnings persistent. They won't be in depth as other articles of C++ experts. I didn't get any chance to work anywhere as a C++ developer, there might be silly or grave mistakes here and there. For the time being, I will ignore those and just move along to maintain my flow.

## References

Most of the codes are inpired from the book [The C++ Standard Library](https://leanpub.com/cpplibrary) by Rainer Grimm and [C++ Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/). I really like his teaching and coding style. He published multiple best C++ books.

Let's begin, shall we?

### Literals

<CollapseComponent
  heading="Literals"
  text="Literals are explicit values in the program."
/>

<br />

Value of literal is fixed, it can also be referred as **constants**. Literal can be value of basic types such as `int`, `bool` etc.

Built in C++ literals are shown below.

```cpp:title=main.cpp
#include <iostream>

int main(){
  // Unsigned integer
  int unsigned_int = u'U';
  // Hexadecimal
  int hex = 0x2b;
  // Raw string
  std::string raw = R"(Raw String)";
  std::cout << unsigned_int << ", " << hex << ", " << raw << std::endl;
}
```

Output

```
85, 42, Raw String
```

- Literals are not restricted to values, even `lambda` function can be a _function literal_

```cpp
lambda function[](std::string text) { return text.length(); }
```

### Raw string literals

Anything between the delimiters of raw string becomes a part of the string.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

const char* string1 = R"foo(
  Hello
  World
  )foo";

int main (){
  std::cout << string1 << std::endl;
}

```

Output

```

  Hello
  World


```

### User defined literals
